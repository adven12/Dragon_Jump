# **Overview**<br />
This is second game for my portfolio. It's remake of the classic Doodle Jump.

## **About the game**<br />
The player controls a dragon which automatically jumps off platforms and tries to avoid falling. The goal is to reach the highest heights and get the biggest score. The game is infinite. Some platforms contain enemies spawned on them. An enemy could be killed by shooting or jumping on it. The player loses when falls down (you can go through the walls) or gets killed by the enemy.

All information from the game is displayed in a separate console window.

Also, you can change the window size from the command-line e.g.: DragonJump -window 640x480.

I used simple framework for the drawing. This source code doesn't have these files, so you can't run the project.
