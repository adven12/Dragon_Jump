# **Overview**<br />
This is second game for my portfolio. It's remake of the classic Doodle Jump.

## **Game controls (in menu):**<br />
Arrow up -> Move cursor to upper item<br />
Arrow down -> Move cursor to lower item<br />
Enter -> Select item<br />
Escape -> Quit the game<br />

## **Game controls (in game):**<br />
Arrow up -> Move snake up<br />
Arrow down -> Move snake down<br />
Arrow left -> Move snake left<br />
Arrow right -> Move snake right<br />

## **How to play?**<br />
When you start the game, you'll see the Menu. You need to collect 5 apples more and than to eat the Bot snake for win. The game has two ways to lose. The First way - you play until you hit your part (you can go through the walls). And be careful, if your snake is smaller than 5 apples, you can be eaten by the opponent!
